# Seeking His Kingdom (SHK)
Monorepo for the SHK website and tools.

## Structure
- `docs/` — GitHub Pages site (set Pages to /docs)
- `tools/` — workbenches, schemas, raw assets (not served)
- `mods/` — reusable code/modules (e.g., lit-import)
- `resources/` — site resource content
- `scripts/` — small utilities (build/validate data)
- `qa/` — test cases and sample queries

See `docs/README.md` for website notes, and `tools/pps/` for the PPS workbench.
