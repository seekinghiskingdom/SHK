  <h2>How to Use This Section</h2>
  <p>
    Historical literature is meant to supplement, not replace, Scripture. These resources can help
    show how believers have articulated and lived out biblical truth in different times and places,
    but they should always be weighed against the Bible itself. (TBD)
