<h1>Strong's Concordance</h1>
<p>
  Strong's Concordance is a comprehensive index of every word in the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible,
  created by Dr. James Strong in the late 19th century. Each original Hebrew and Greek word is assigned a unique
  number, known as a "Strong's number," which allows readers to study the original languages of the Bible
  without needing to know Hebrew or Greek. (AI)
