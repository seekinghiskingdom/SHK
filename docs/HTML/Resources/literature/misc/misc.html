    <h2>What Might Appear Here (TBD)</h2>
    <p>
      This section will explain the kinds of “miscellaneous” items that may be collected here—drafts, notes,
      experimental formats, or one-off documents. (TBD)
    </p>

    <h2>How to Treat These Resources (TBD)</h2>
    <p>
      A short note that these items may be more provisional or exploratory, with encouragement to always
      weigh them carefully against Scripture. (TBD)
