  <h2>AI-Assisted Development & Content</h2>
  <p>
    Parts of this site (including code, layout, and processing written information) are created or assisted using
    AI tools. I am a full time graduate student, so I use AI to make up for lack of technical abilities, which makes this project possible. 
    Although I review and test what is produced, please be aware that errors are possible, and that I do not claim 
    that anything on this site is infallible and equal to scripture. Soon, all AI-assisted content will be labeled accordingly.
  </p>

    By using this site, you understand that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Code and tools may contain bugs or inaccuracies and should be used at your own risk.</li>
    <li>Textual content drafted with AI may require refinement and should not be treated as infallible.</li>
    <li>You remain responsible for verifying anything important before relying on it in practice, teaching, or other work.</li>
