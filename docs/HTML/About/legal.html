    <h2>Use of AI (TBD)</h2>
    <p>
      Parts of this site (including code, layout, and processing written information) are created or assisted using
      AI tools. I am a full time graduate student, so I use AI to make up for lack of technical abilities, which makes this project possible. 
      Although I review and test what is produced, please be aware that errors are possible, and that I do not claim 
      that anything on this site is infallible and equal to scripture. Soon, all AI-assisted content will be labeled accordingly.

    <p>
