    If you or someone you know really needs prayer, please reach out to a local church or a trusted
    believer in your area. Being connected to a church family that can pray with you and walk with
    you is extremely important for your life and walk with Jesus. (TBD)

    You can also use our
    <a href="{{ '/community/find-a-church/' | relative_url }}">Find a Church</a>
    page as a starting point to help you look for a church near you.
