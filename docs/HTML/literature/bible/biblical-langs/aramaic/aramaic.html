    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Closely related to Hebrew, Aramaic shares many structural features but has its own vocabulary and expressions, showing up in key narrative and prophetic sections as well as in certain quoted phrases in the Gospels. -AI
    </p>
    <p>
      On this site, Aramaic resources will focus on highlighting the passages where Aramaic occurs, offering basic lexical information, and connecting those words to the surrounding Hebrew and Greek context. -AI

      <li>
        Aramaic passage and word lists are planned and will be linked here as they become available, alongside notes on how they relate to nearby Hebrew and Greek terms. -AI
      </li>

        You can already use Strong’s numbers and translation tools on this site to begin tracing Aramaic-related verses, even before dedicated Aramaic datasets are fully in place. -AI
