    <h2>About Strong’s Concordance</h2>
    <p>
      In this site, Strong’s numbers act as a bridge between English translations and the underlying Hebrew and Greek words, so you can move from a verse to the original term, its basic gloss, and related occurrences. -AI
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Strong’s entry page provides the Strong’s number, the lemma (original-language form), a brief gloss, and links or references that can be expanded in future versions of the project. -AI

  <section class="page-section strongs-language" id="strongs-hebrew">
    <h2>Strong’s Hebrew Lexicon (H-numbers)</h2>
    <p>
      The Hebrew Strong’s lexicon covers words from the Old Testament, which was primarily written in Biblical Hebrew (with some Aramaic), a consonant-rich Semitic language used by ancient Israel. -AI
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Hebrew entry is labeled with an H-number (e.g., H0001) and links the English translation back to a specific Hebrew lemma, providing a starting point for word studies and cross-references. -AI

    <h2>Strong’s Greek Lexicon (G-numbers)</h2>
    <p>
      The Greek Strong’s lexicon covers words from the New Testament, written in Koine Greek, the common dialect of the eastern Mediterranean world during the first century. -AI
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Greek entry is labeled with a G-number (e.g., G0001) and connects English translations to their underlying Greek lemmas, helping you trace how a term is used across different passages. -AI
