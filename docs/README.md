# SHK Website
Static site served from `/docs` (GitHub Pages).

## Pages
- Home (`index.html`)
- About (`about.html`)
- Resources (`resources.html`)
- Tools (`tools.html`)
- PPS page is linked from Tools.

## To-Do:
1. Update the "Back to Home" button on the Privacy page to "Back to About."
2. Ensure the Tools hub path is correct so PPS and other related links don’t 404.
3. Add a back button to the Strong’s section.
4. Update the Bible index page to a full Literature index and include all intended categories.
5. Add pages for Bible Studies, Articles and Books, and Miscellaneous Literature.
6. Change the "Back to Home" button on the Tools page to "Back to Resources."
7. Fix the Help section’s “Using the Tools” link to avoid the 404 by correcting the Tools hub path.
8. Add final destinations for the Daily Tools buttons on the Home screen (currently dummy links).
9. Add an AI disclaimer on the Home screen.
