# SHK Site Data (v1)

These folders contain small JSON shards generated by `tools/lit-import`.
The `.gitkeep` files ensure directories exist in git before the first build.

- `strongs/` → `index.json` and A–Z shards (exported by `shk-lit export-pages`)
- `kjv/verses/` → per-book JSON (e.g., `GEN.json`, `EXO.json`, ...)

You can keep this README or remove it after your first export.
