And receive them, and repent. These things says the man to them that trust in God; and I cease. And there is not in me the wisdom of men. And I know the knowledge of the holy. Who has gathered the winds in his bosom? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has dominion of all the ends of the earth? What is his name? or what is the name of his children? And he defends those that reverence him. Lest he reprove thee, and thou be made a liar. Take not favor from me before I die. And give me not wealth orpoverty; But appoint me what is needful and sufficient: Or be poor and steal, and swear vainlyby the name of God. Lest he curse thee, and thou be utterly destroyed. And do not bless their mother. But do not cleanse their way. And exalt themselves with their eyelids. So as to destroy and devour the lowly from the earth, And the poor of them from among men."
