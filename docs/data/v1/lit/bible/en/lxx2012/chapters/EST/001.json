      "text": "[In the second year of the reign of Artaxerxes the great king, on the first \\add day\\add* of Nisan, Mardochaeus the \\add son\\add* of Jarius, the \\add son\\add* of Semeias, the \\add son\\add* of Cisaus, of the tribe of Benjamine, a Jew dwelling in the city Susa, a great man, serving in the king's palace, saw a vision. Now he was of the captivity which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried captive from Jerusalem, with Jachonias the king of Judea. And this was his dream: Behold, voices and a noise, thunders and earthquake, tumult upon the earth. And, behold, two great serpents came forth, both ready for conflict, and there came from them a great voice, and by their voice every nation was prepared for battle, even to fight against the nation of the just. And, behold, a day of darkness and blackness, tribulation and anguish, affection and tumult upon the earth. And all the righteous nation was troubled, fearing their own afflictions; and they prepared to die, and cried to God: and from their cry there came as it were a great river from a little fountain, \\add even\\add* much water. And light and the sun arose, and the lowly were exalted, and devoured the honorable. And Mardochaeus who had seen this vision and what God desired to do, having \\f + \\fr 1:1 \\fl Or, \\ft arisen. \\f* awoke, kept it in his heart, and desired by all means to interpret it, even till night. And Mardochaeus rested quiet in the palace with Gabatha and Tharrha the king's two chamberlains, eunuchs who guarded the palace. And he heard their reasoning and searched out their plans, and learned that they were preparing to lay hands on king Artaxerxes: and he informed the king concerning them. And the king examined the two chamberlains, and they confessed, and were \\f + \\fr 1:1 \\fl Lit \\ft led away, see Acts 12:19. \\f* executed. And the king wrote these things for a memorial: also Mardochaeus wrote concerning these matters. And the king commanded Mardochaeus to attend in the palace, and gave gifts for this service. And Aman the son of Amadathes the Bugean was honorable in the sight of the king, and he endeavored to hurt Mardochaeus and his people, because of the two chamberlains of the king.] \\f + \\fr 1:1 \\fl Note. - \\ft In the \\fl Heb. \\ft and some copies of LXX, Esther begins here. \\f* And it came to pass after these \\f + \\fr 1:1 \\fl Gr. \\ft words. \\f* things in the days of Artaxerxes, —(this Artaxerxes ruled over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India)—"
