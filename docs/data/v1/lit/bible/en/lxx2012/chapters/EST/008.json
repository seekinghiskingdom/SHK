And the following is the copy of the letter of the orders. \\f + \\fr 8:13 \\ft the passages in brackets are not in the \\fl Hebrew.\\f* [The great king Artaxerxes sends greetings to the rulers of provinces \\add in\\add* one hundred and twenty-seven satrapies, from India to Ethiopia, even to those who are faithful to our interests. Many who have been frequently honored by the most abundant kindness of their \\f + \\fr 8:13 \\ft perhaps rulers, see Luke 22:25. \\f* benefactors have conceived ambitious designs, and not only endeavor to hurt our subjects, but moreover, not being able to bear prosperity, they also endeavor to plot against their own benefactors. And they not only would utterly abolish gratitude from among men, but also, elated by the boastings of men who are strangers to all that is good, they supposed that they shall escape the sin-hating vengeance of the ever-seeing God. And oftentimes \\add evil\\add* exhortation has made partakers of the guilt of shedding innocent blood, and has involved in irremediable calamities, many of those who had been appointed to offices of authority, who had been entrusted with the management of their friends' affairs; while \\add men\\add*, by the false sophistry of an evil disposition, have deceived the simple candour of the ruling powers. And it is possible to see \\add this\\add*, not so much from more ancient traditionary accounts, as it is immediately in your power \\add to see it\\add* by examining what things have been wickedly \\f + \\fr 8:13 \\fl Gr. \\ft contrived. \\f* perpetrated by the baseness of men unworthily holding power. And \\add it is right\\add* to take heed with regard to the future, that we may maintain the government in undisturbed peace for all men, adopting \\add needful\\add* changes, and ever judging those cases which come under our notice, with truly equitable decision. For whereas Aman, a Macedonian, the son of Amadathes, in reality an alien from the blood of the Persians, and differing widely from our mild course of government, having been hospitable entertained by us, obtained so large a share of our universal kindness, as to be called our father, and to continue the person next to the royal throne, reverenced of all; \\add he however\\add*, \\f + \\fr 8:13 \\fl Gr. \\ft not having borne. \\f* overcome by the pride \\add of his station\\add*, endeavored to deprive us of our dominion, and our \\f + \\fr 8:13 \\fl Gr. \\ft spirit. \\f* life: having by various and subtle artifices demanded for destruction both Mardochaeus our deliverer and perpetual benefactor, and Esther the blameless consort of \\add our\\add* kingdom, with their whole nation. For by these methods he thought, having surprised us in a defenceless state, to transfer the dominion of the Persians to the Macedonians. But we find that the Jews, who have been consigned to destruction by the \\f + \\fr 8:13 \\fl Gr. \\ft thrice guilty. \\f* most abominable of men, are not malefactors, but living according to the justest laws, and being the sons of the living God, the most high and \\f + \\fr 8:13 \\fl Gr. \\ft greatest. \\f* mighty, who maintains the kingdom. to us as well as to our forefathers, in the most excellent order. You⌃ will therefore do well in refusing to obey the letter sent by Aman the son of Amadathes, because he that has done these things, has been hanged with his whole family at the gates of Susa, Almighty God having swiftly returned to him a worthy recompence, \\add We enjoin you\\add* then, having openly published a copy of this letter in every place, to give the Jews permission to use their own lawful customs, and to strengthen them, that on the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar, on the self-same day, they may defend themselves against those who attack them in a time of affliction. For in the place of the destruction of the chosen race, Almighty God has granted them this \\add time of\\add* gladness. Do you⌃ therefore also, among your \\add notable\\add* feasts, keep a distinct day with all festivity, that both now and hereafter it may be a day of deliverance to us and who are well disposed toward the Persians, but to those that plotted against us a memorial of destruction. And every city and province collectively, which shall not do accordingly, shall be consumed with vengeance by spear and fire: it shall be made not only inaccessible to men, but most hateful to wild beasts and birds for ever.] And let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom and let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies."
