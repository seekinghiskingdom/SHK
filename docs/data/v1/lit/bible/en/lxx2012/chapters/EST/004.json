And you are Lord of all, and there is no one who shall resist you Lord. You know all things: you know, Lord, that it is not in insolence, nor haughtiness, nor love of glory, that I have done this, to refuse obeisance to the haughty Aman. For I would gladly have kissed the soles of his feet for the safety of Israel. But I have done this, that I might not set the glory of man above the glory of God: and I will not worship any one except you, my Lord, and I will not do these things in haughtiness. And now, O Lord God, the King, the God of Abraam, spare your people, for \\add our enemies\\add* are looking upon us to \\add our\\add* destruction, and they have desired to destroy your ancient inheritance. Do not overlook your \\f + \\fr 4:17 \\fl Gr. \\ft portion. \\f* peculiar people, whom you have redeemed for yourself out of the land of Egypt. Listen to my prayer, and be propitious to your inheritance, and turn our mourning into gladness, that we may live and sing praise to your name, O Lord; and do not utterly destroy the mouth of them that praise you, O Lord. And all Israel cried with \\add all\\add* their might, for death \\add was\\add* before their eyes. And queen Esther betook herself for refuge to the Lord, being taken \\add as it were\\add* in the agony of death. And having taken off her glorious apparel, she put on garments of distress and mourning; and instead of grand perfumes she filled her head with ashes and dung, and she greatly brought down her body, and she filled every place of her glad adorning with the \\add torn\\add* curls of her hair. And she implored the Lord God of Israel, and said, O my Lord, you alone are our king: help me \\add who am\\add* destitute, and have no helper but you, for my danger \\add is\\add* \\f + \\fr 4:17 \\fl Gr. \\ft in my hand. \\f* near at hand. I have heard from my birth, in the tribe of my kindred that you, Lord, took Israel out of all the nations, and our fathers out of all their kindred for a perpetual inheritance, and have wrought for them all that you have said. And now we have sinned before you, and you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies, because we honored their gods: you are righteous, O Lord. But now they have not been contented with the bitterness of our slavery, but have laid their hands on the hands of their idols, \\add in order\\add* to abolish the decree of your mouth, and utterly to destroy your inheritances, and to stop the mouth of them that praise you, and to extinguish the glory of your house and your altar, and to open the mouth of the Gentiles to \\add speak\\add* the \\f + \\fr 4:17 \\fl Gr. \\ft virtues. \\f* praises of vanities, and \\add in order\\add* that a mortal king should be admired for ever. O Lord, do not resign your sceptre to them that are not, and let them not laugh at our fall, but turn their counsel against themselves, and make an example of him who has \\f + \\fr 4:17 \\fl Gr. \\ft begun against us. \\f* begun \\add to injure\\add* us.
