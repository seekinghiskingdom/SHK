In the first place it seems evident that the LXX. read בסך, and the English translators בסר, or something similar. The Hebrew Text (to which no קרי is appended) thus far favours the LXX.; who, however, appear to have read אררס as a part of ארר, and made an adjective of it. Again, τόπῳ has nothing immediately answering it in the Hebrew, and may be accounted for on the principle so often referred to of \\fl double translation.\\f*"
