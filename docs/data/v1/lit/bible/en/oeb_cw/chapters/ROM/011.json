      "verse": 12,
      "text": "And, if their falling away has enriched the world, and their failure has enriched the Gentiles, how much more will result from their full restoration!"

    },
    {
      "verse": 20,
      "text": "True, it was because of their want of faith that they were broken off, and it is because of your faith that you are standing. Do not think too highly of yourself, but beware."

      "verse": 24,
      "text": "If you were cut off from your natural stock – a wild olive – and were grafted, contrary to the course of nature, on a good olive, much more will they – the natural branches – be grafted back into their parent tree."
    },
    {
      "verse": 25,
      "text": "My friends, so that you don’t think too highly of yourselves, I want you to recognise the truth, hitherto hidden, that the callousness which has come over Israel is only partial, and will continue only until the whole Gentile world has been gathered in."
